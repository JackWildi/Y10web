What Is an Earthquake?
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
An earthquake is an intense shaking of Earth’s surface. The shaking is caused by movements in Earth’s outermost layer.

How Do We Measure Earthquakes?
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
The energy from an earthquake travels through Earth in vibrations called seismic waves. Scientists can measure these seismic waves on instruments called seismometer. A seismometer detects seismic waves below the instrument and records them as a series of zig-zags.
        
        
        <br>
        <br>
    

Scientists can determine the time, location and intensity of an earthquake from the information recorded by a seismometer. This record also provides information about the rocks the seismic waves traveled through.
